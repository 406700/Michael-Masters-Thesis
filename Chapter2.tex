\section{Ohmic Contacts}

\subsection{Silicide Technology}

Silicide self alligned layers (salicides) are the dominant industry method for creating ohmic contacts to semiconductor devices. This is due to the metal-like resistivity of silicides and their stability at high temperatures. Common silicides used in the industry are TiSi, WSi, CoSi and NiSi. Of these NiSi has the lowest formation temperature.
