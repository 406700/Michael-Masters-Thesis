\subsection{Design of the study}
Fibers were chosen with different core materials to investigate crystallinity, defects and doping that may occur during fiber drawing. The study is designed in two parts. The first is to give an idea of the resistivities achieved in previous fiber draws for core materials of different starting resistivities. There is little data available MCD fibers and this serves the purpose to give an understanding of what may happen during different drawing conditions, the consistency of the results, as well as highlight other trends. The second part is a comparison of Si and SiGe fibers with two coatings  that are currently being investigated %(for?).
It is of interest to see if the borate coatings will heavily dope the core, as boron is a common dopant of Si.
