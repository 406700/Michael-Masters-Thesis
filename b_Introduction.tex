Semiconductor core optical fibers are an emerging technology with many promising applications 
\cite{Peacock2016SiliconFuture, Ballato2018Perspective:Applications,Healy2018AFibres}. Non-linear optics


\cite{Kingsbury2018JunctionPermselectivity}
My reasons for measuring resistivity? No method for measuring resisitivity of fibers which is a key for understanding the quality of the core material due to doping etc. 
Semiconductor core fibers written like a paper intro. very straight forward. 
Alloy fibers, first SiGe fibers. Look up more motivation for SiGe. Heavily doped SiGe. 

Here we ... report on a new methods of electrical characterization and demonstrate the ability to perform hall or 4pp measurements along a fiber core with micrometer positioning accuracy. A sound method of eletrical measurement will speed fiber development. 
In this work we investigate the doping that takes place during fiber drawing on Si and SiGe fibers with different interface modifiers. The  

HPCVD allows for different materials to be deposited layer by layer, where MCD fibers require additional processing steps to
